# 🚀 AI-Enabled Vendor Governance & Risk Intelligence System

An end-to-end AI-driven decision support system designed to transform telecom vendor governance from reactive escalation to proactive, data-driven risk intelligence.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Telecom vendor governance often suffers from:

- Delivery delays
- Cost overruns
- Compliance gaps
- Escalation-driven firefighting

This project builds an AI-powered intelligence layer that:

✔ Predicts vendor deterioration risk  
✔ Quantifies financial exposure  
✔ Forecasts delivery delays  
✔ Detects delay anomalies  
✔ Triggers automatic escalation  
✔ Provides role-based action recommendations

## 🧠 Core Components

### 🔢 Vendor Performance Index (VPI)
Composite score based on:
- Delivery performance
- Quality metrics
- Compliance factors
- Commercial discipline

### 🤖 Predictive Risk Model
- Random Forest Classifier
- Class imbalance handled using `class_weight`
- Outputs deterioration probability
- Risk classification: Low / Moderate / High / Critical

### 💸 Financial Impact Simulation
Estimates:
- Working capital exposure
- Delivery delay cost impact
- Penalty exposure
- Estimated savings via mitigation

### 📈 Time-Series Intelligence
- Monthly delivery trend
- ARIMA forecasting (next 3 months)
- Rolling Z-score anomaly detection
- Automatic escalation logic

---

## 📊 Dashboard Modules

- 🔧 Operations Dashboard
- 💰 SCM Dashboard
- 📉 Predictive Risk Intelligence
- 💸 Financial Impact Simulation
- 📈 Delivery Time-Series & Escalation

## 📌 Executive Summary

This project builds a multi-layer AI system for telecom vendor governance integrating:

- Vendor Performance Index (VPI)
- ML-based deterioration risk prediction
- Financial impact quantification
- Time-series forecasting
- Anomaly-driven escalation engine
- Role-based operational dashboards

The system enables leadership to shift from reactive firefighting to proactive, data-driven decision intelligence.
